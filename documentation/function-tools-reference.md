## Overview

The Receptionist agent exposes four function tools to the OpenAI Realtime model:

| Tool | Purpose | Triggers |
|------|---------|----------|
| `lookup_faq` | Search configured FAQs for an answer | Caller asks a question about the business |
| `transfer_call` | Transfer the call to a department/person | Caller requests to speak with someone specific |
| `take_message` | Record a message from the caller | Caller wants to leave a message |
| `get_business_hours` | Check current open/closed status | Caller asks about business hours |

These tools are defined as methods on the `Receptionist` class in `agent.py`, decorated with `@function_tool()`. The LiveKit Agents SDK and OpenAI Realtime API handle the serialization, invocation, and result passing automatically.

## How Function Tools Work

### Architecture

```
Caller speaks → OpenAI Realtime API (understands intent)
                       │
                       ▼
              Model decides to call a tool
                       │
                       ▼
              Tool call sent to agent
                       │
                       ▼
              Agent executes tool method
                       │
                       ▼
              Result returned to model
                       │
                       ▼
              Model speaks the response to caller
```

### Lifecycle

1. The caller says something that requires an action (e.g., "Can I leave a message?").
2. The OpenAI Realtime model determines that a tool call is appropriate.
3. The model generates a tool call with the tool name and arguments.
4. The LiveKit Agents SDK routes the call to the corresponding method on the `Receptionist` class.
5. The method executes and returns a string result.
6. The result is sent back to the model.
7. The model incorporates the result into its next spoken response.

### Tool Definitions

Tools are defined as async methods with the `@function_tool()` decorator. The method signature defines the parameters, and the docstring defines the tool description sent to the model:

```python
@function_tool()
async def my_tool(self, param: str) -> str:
    """Description used by the model to decide when to call this tool.

    Args:
        param: Description of the parameter.
    """
    return "result string"
```

---

## lookup_faq

### Purpose

Searches the business's configured FAQ entries for an answer to the caller's question. Provides structured knowledge retrieval to supplement the LLM's system prompt knowledge.

### Signature

```python
@function_tool()
async def lookup_faq(self, question: str) -> str
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `question` | str | Yes | The caller's question or a rephrased version of it. |

### Return Value

- **Match found**: Returns the answer from the matching FAQ entry.
- **No match**: Returns a neutral message such as "I don't have a specific FAQ entry for that question. Let me see if I can help based on what I know." This message is designed to prompt the LLM to fall back to its system prompt knowledge rather than simply saying "I don't know."

### Matching Algorithm

The tool performs **case-insensitive substring matching** against the `question` field of each FAQ entry in the configuration:

```python
# Pseudocode
query = question.lower()
for faq in config.faqs:
    if query in faq.question.lower():
        return faq.answer
return "no specific FAQ match" message
```

### Matching Behavior

| Caller Question | FAQ Question | Match? |
|----------------|-------------|--------|
| "Do you take insurance?" | "What insurance do you accept?" | Yes ("insurance" substring) |
| "Where is your office?" | "Where are you located?" | Yes ("where" substring) |
| "What are your prices?" | "Do you accept new patients?" | No |

### Design Notes

- **Substring matching was chosen over semantic search** for simplicity and determinism. It works well for the typical 10-20 FAQ entries a small business has.
- **FAQs are also embedded in the system prompt**, so the LLM has access to this knowledge even without calling the tool. The tool provides a structured retrieval mechanism that reinforces accuracy.
- **The "no match" response is deliberately neutral** — it does not say "I don't know" because the LLM may actually know the answer from its system prompt.

### Example Interaction

```
Caller: "What kind of insurance do you guys take?"

→ Model calls: lookup_faq(question="what insurance do you accept")
← Tool returns: "We accept most major dental insurance plans including
   Delta Dental, Cigna, Aetna, MetLife, and United Healthcare. We also
   offer a discount for patients paying out of pocket."

Agent speaks: "We accept most major dental insurance plans including
Delta Dental, Cigna, Aetna, MetLife, and United Healthcare. If you're
paying out of pocket, we do offer a discount as well."
```

## transfer_call

### Purpose

Transfers the active phone call to a specific department or person by initiating a SIP transfer through the LiveKit API.

### Signature

```python
@function_tool()
async def transfer_call(self, department: str) -> str
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `department` | str | Yes | The name of the department or person to transfer to. |

### Return Value

- **Success**: Returns a confirmation message (e.g., "Transferring you to Scheduling now.").
- **Department not found**: Returns a message indicating the department was not recognized, along with available options.
- **Transfer failure**: Returns a sanitized error message (no internal details exposed).

### Transfer Process

1. The tool receives the department name.
2. It performs a **case-insensitive match** against the `name` field of each routing entry in the configuration.
3. If a match is found:
   a. The agent announces the transfer to the caller (e.g., "Let me transfer you to Scheduling.").
   b. The agent calls the LiveKit SIP transfer API with the matched phone number.
   c. The SIP transfer is initiated (the caller is connected to the target number).
4. If no match is found, the tool returns available departments.

### Matching Behavior

| Caller Request | Routing Entry Name | Match? |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| "scheduling" | "Scheduling" | Yes (case-insensitive) |
| "BILLING" | "Billing" | Yes (case-insensitive) |
| "accounts" | "Billing" | No (not a substring match) |
| "Dr. Smith" | "Dr. Smith" | Yes (case-insensitive) |

### LiveKit SIP Transfer

The actual transfer is performed using the LiveKit API. The agent calls into LiveKit's SIP transfer endpoint, which instructs the SIP gateway to perform a REFER or re-INVITE to the target phone number.

```python
# Simplified pseudocode
participant = self._get_caller_identity()
await livekit_api.sip_transfer(participant, target_number)
```

### Error Handling

- **SIP transfer failures** (network issues, invalid numbers, etc.) are caught and returned as sanitized messages. The caller hears something like "I'm sorry, I wasn't able to complete the transfer. Would you like to try again or leave a message?" — never a stack trace or internal error code.
- **No routing entries configured**: If the business has an empty routing list, the system prompt instructs the LLM not to offer transfers.

### Caller Identity

The `_get_caller_identity()` helper method finds the SIP participant in the LiveKit room. In a typical SIP call, there is one remote participant (the caller) and the agent. The helper identifies the caller by finding the participant that is not the agent.

### Example Interaction

```
Caller: "Can you transfer me to billing?"

→ Model calls: transfer_call(department="billing")
  → Agent announces: "Let me transfer you to our billing department."
  → Agent initiates SIP transfer to +15551234002
← Tool returns: "Transferring you to Billing now."

[Call is transferred to the billing department]
```

### Example: Department Not Found

```
Caller: "Can I speak to the IT department?"

→ Model calls: transfer_call(department="IT")
← Tool returns: "I don't have a transfer option for IT. I can
   transfer you to Scheduling, Billing, or Clinical. Which would
   you prefer?"

Agent speaks: "I'm sorry, I don't have a direct line for IT.
I can transfer you to Scheduling, Billing, or Clinical.
Would any of those help?"
```

## take_message

### Purpose

Records a message from the caller, including their name, callback number, and the message content. The message is persisted according to the business's configured delivery method.

### Signature

```python
@function_tool()
async def take_message(self, caller_name: str, message: str, callback_number: str) -> str
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `caller_name` | str | Yes | The caller's name. |
| `message` | str | Yes | The message the caller wants to leave. |
| `callback_number` | str | Yes | The phone number to call back. |

### Return Value

Returns a confirmation message (e.g., "Your message has been recorded. Someone will call you back as soon as possible.").

### Message Storage Process

1. A `Message` dataclass is created with:
   - `caller_name`: From the tool parameter.
   - `callback_number`: From the tool parameter.
   - `message`: From the tool parameter.
   - `business_name`: From the loaded business configuration.
   - `timestamp`: Automatically set to current UTC time.

2. `save_message()` is called via `asyncio.to_thread()` to avoid blocking the event loop.

3. Based on the delivery method:
   - **File**: A JSON file is written to the configured `file_path` directory.
   - **Webhook**: (Not yet implemented) Would POST the message to the configured URL.

### File Storage Details

**File naming**: `message_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_ffffff.json`
- Format uses UTC timestamp with microsecond precision.
- Example: `message_20260302_143025_123456.json`

**File content**:
```json
{
  "caller_name": "Jane Doe",
  "callback_number": "555-867-5309",
  "message": "I need to reschedule my appointment for next Tuesday. Please call me back when you get a chance.",
  "business_name": "Acme Dental",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-02T14:30:25.123456+00:00"
}
```

### Async I/O

The `take_message` tool uses `asyncio.to_thread(save_message, ...)` to perform file I/O without blocking the event loop. This is critical because:

- The event loop handles real-time audio processing.
- Blocking the loop would cause audio glitches or dropped frames.
- `to_thread()` delegates the file write to a thread pool worker.

### Example Interaction

```
Caller: "Can I leave a message? This is John Smith, my number is
555-123-4567, and I need to cancel my appointment tomorrow."

→ Model calls: take_message(
    caller_name="John Smith",
    message="Needs to cancel appointment tomorrow",
    callback_number="555-123-4567"
  )
← Tool returns: "Your message has been recorded. Someone from
   Acme Dental will call you back as soon as possible."

Agent speaks: "I've taken down your message, John. Someone from
our office will call you back at 555-123-4567 as soon as possible.
Is there anything else I can help with?"
```

### Edge Cases

- **Caller won't give their name**: The LLM will pass whatever the caller provides. If the caller refuses, the LLM may pass "Anonymous" or ask again depending on the personality instructions.
- **Callback number format**: The tool accepts any string. Phone number validation is not enforced — the LLM typically captures what the caller says naturally (e.g., "555-123-4567").
- **Long messages**: No length limit is enforced. The LLM naturally summarizes long caller messages into the `message` parameter.

## get_business_hours

### Purpose

Returns the current open/closed status of the business and the full weekly schedule, using the business's configured timezone for accurate time calculations.

### Signature

```python
@function_tool()
async def get_business_hours(self) -> str
```

### Parameters

None. This tool takes no parameters — it uses the business configuration and current time.

### Return Value

Returns a formatted string containing:
1. Current open/closed status.
2. If open: today's closing time.
3. If closed: when the business next opens.
4. Full weekly schedule.

### Timezone Handling

The tool uses Python's `zoneinfo` module (standard library in Python 3.9+) to determine the current time in the business's configured timezone:

```python
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
from datetime import datetime

tz = ZoneInfo(config.business.timezone)  # e.g., "America/New_York"
now = datetime.now(tz)
current_day = now.strftime("%A").lower()  # e.g., "monday"
current_time = now.strftime("%H:%M")      # e.g., "14:30"
```

### Open/Closed Determination

The tool uses **lexicographic string comparison** on HH:MM formatted times:

```python
day_hours = getattr(config.hours, current_day)

if day_hours is None:
    # Business is closed today
    status = "closed"
elif day_hours.open <= current_time <= day_hours.close:
    # Business is currently open
    status = "open"
else:
    # Outside of today's hours
    status = "closed"
```

**Why lexicographic comparison works**: In HH:MM 24-hour format, string comparison produces the correct temporal ordering. `"08:00" < "14:30" < "17:00"` is both alphabetically and temporally true.

### Example Returns

**When open**:
```
Acme Dental is currently OPEN.
Today's hours: 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM (Eastern Time)

Weekly schedule:
  Monday:    8:00 AM - 5:00 PM
  Tuesday:   8:00 AM - 5:00 PM
  Wednesday: 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM
  Thursday:  8:00 AM - 5:00 PM
  Friday:    8:00 AM - 3:00 PM
  Saturday:  Closed
  Sunday:    Closed
```

**When closed (after hours)**:
```
Acme Dental is currently CLOSED.
We reopen Monday at 8:00 AM (Eastern Time)

Weekly schedule:
  Monday:    8:00 AM - 5:00 PM
  Tuesday:   8:00 AM - 5:00 PM
  ...
```

### Example Interaction

```
Caller: "What time do you close today?"

→ Model calls: get_business_hours()
← Tool returns: "Acme Dental is currently OPEN. Today's hours:
   8:00 AM to 5:00 PM (Eastern Time). [full schedule]"

Agent speaks: "We're currently open! Today we're here until
5 PM Eastern. Would you like to schedule an appointment?"
```

### Edge Cases

- **Timezone not found**: If the configured timezone is invalid, `ZoneInfo` will raise an exception. This is caught during config validation.
- **Daylight Saving Time**: `zoneinfo` handles DST transitions automatically. The tool always reports the correct local time.
- **Midnight crossing**: The current implementation assumes business hours do not cross midnight (e.g., no "22:00 to 02:00" schedules). This is a reasonable constraint for most small businesses.

---

## Tool Interaction Patterns

### Sequential Tool Calls

The model may call multiple tools in sequence during a single conversation turn:

```
Caller: "Are you open, and can I speak to someone about insurance?"

→ Model calls: get_business_hours()
← Returns: "Currently OPEN, closes at 5 PM"

→ Model calls: lookup_faq(question="insurance")
← Returns: "We accept Delta Dental, Cigna, ..."

Agent speaks: "Yes, we're open until 5 PM today. Regarding insurance,
we accept Delta Dental, Cigna, Aetna, and several other major plans.
Would you like me to transfer you to our billing department for
specific coverage questions?"
```

### Tool Call After Conversational Context

The model gathers information conversationally before calling a tool:

```
Agent: "I'd be happy to take a message. May I have your name?"
Caller: "It's Sarah Johnson."
Agent: "And what's the best number to reach you?"
Caller: "555-987-6543"
Agent: "What message would you like to leave?"
Caller: "I need to reschedule my cleaning for next week."

→ Model calls: take_message(
    caller_name="Sarah Johnson",
    callback_number="555-987-6543",
    message="Needs to reschedule cleaning for next week"
  )
```

### Tool Call Declined

The model may decide not to call a tool even when one seems relevant, relying on system prompt knowledge instead:

```
Caller: "Do you do teeth whitening?"

# The model may answer from its system prompt knowledge about the
# dental office without calling lookup_faq, if the personality
# instructions or FAQ content in the prompt already covers this.
```

---

## Error Handling

### General Principles

1. **Sanitize all error messages**: Never expose internal details (file paths, stack traces, API errors) to the caller.
2. **Provide helpful alternatives**: When a tool fails, suggest what the caller can do instead.
3. **Log full errors internally**: While the caller gets a sanitized message, the full error is logged for debugging.

### Per-Tool Error Behavior

| Tool | Error Scenario | Caller Hears |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `lookup_faq` | No match found | LLM falls back to system prompt knowledge |
| `transfer_call` | Department not found | Available departments listed |
| `transfer_call` | SIP transfer fails | Apology + offer to take a message instead |
| `take_message` | File write fails | Apology + ask to try again |
| `get_business_hours` | Config error | General hours from system prompt |

---

## Extending the Tool Set

To add a new function tool, follow the pattern established by the existing four. See the [Development Guide](development-guide.md#adding-a-new-function-tool) for step-by-step instructions.

### Planned Future Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `check_appointment` | Look up caller's existing appointments | Planned |
| `schedule_appointment` | Book a new appointment | Planned |
| `get_wait_time` | Estimate current hold/wait times | Planned |
| `escalate_to_human` | Connect to a live operator | Planned |

These would require additional integrations (calendar API, queue system, etc.) beyond the current scope.
